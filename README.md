## IRC

Join us on **IRC** at `#nashdl` on `freenode` for live chat anytime.

## Github Issues

To try to stay on track, please post questions/topics for discussion as an open issue on https://github.com/nashdl/bookclub/issues

Go ahead and fork the repo to add notes/code/etc. Anything you think would help out the discussion.

## Google Hangout

There will be a Google Hangout in addition to the physical locations listed below. You can decide whether you would prefer to attend at a meatspace or would rather join the Hangout directly. Keep in mind that Hangouts are limited to 10, so based on attendance there might not be room for you to join the discussion. We will also broadcast the hangout so you can view even if you can't join the discussion.

We're looking for additional locations in other parts of town. Let me know if you have a space you'd be willing to volunteer. I'd like to try to find locations in Brentwood and West Nashville.

We're trying this format as an experiment. Do be patient while we work out the kinks.
